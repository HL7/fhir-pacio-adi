# Since this IG is based on FHIR R4, the pattern discriminator is still valid. The deprecation warning is for future R5+ compatibility, but it won't break the current implementation.
%The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)%

# The additional specified codes are essential for the management of advance directive documents. The ADI specification team is working with the Structured Documents Working Group to add these additional codes.
%Binding http://hl7.org/fhir/us/pacio-adi/ValueSet/ADIDocumentReferenceStatusVS is not a subset of binding http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/composition-status|4.0.1 because The codes 'current,superseded,entered-in-error' are not in the base valueset%
