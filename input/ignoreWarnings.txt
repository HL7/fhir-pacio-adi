# Approved US Core Variance for CarePlan and Observation profiles - https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-34110

# Since this IG is based on FHIR R4, the pattern discriminator is still valid. The deprecation warning is for future R5+ compatibility, but it won't break the current implementation.
%The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)%


# XHTML-related error to div. Not relevant if set to div status is generated.
%The markdown contains content that appears to be an embedded HTML tag starting at '<d'. This will (or SHOULD) be escaped by the presentation layer. The content should be checked to confirm that this is the desired behaviour%

# These are local codes that are specific to the context of Advance Directives. Still, the PACIO ADI team intends to continue following the process to work with LOINC and SNOMED to add these codes.
%Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)%

# Advance Directive documents require document types that are currently not supported in US Core. The ADI team is working with Structure Documents and US Core for better alignment. In the meantime, we had to fall back to the DocumentReference base resource.
%US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on DocumentReference derive from one of the base US profiles. See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/US+Core+Variance+Request+Process.%

# The repeating element pattern is intentional for consistency in each ADI profile.
