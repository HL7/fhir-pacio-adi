# Approved US Core Variance for CarePlan and Observation profiles - https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-34110

# The USCoreProvenance profile, from which the ADIProvenance profile is based, has the following warnings:
provenance-1: The left side is inherently a collection, and so the expression '%resource.agent.who.resolve() is Practitioner' may fail or return false if there is more than one item in the content being evaluated
provenance-1: The left side is inherently a collection, and so the expression '%resource.agent.who.resolve() is Device' may fail or return false if there is more than one item in the content being evaluated

# The following warning is related to the USCoreProvenance profile and not further specified in the ADI Provenance profile.
%There are multiple different potential matches for the url 'http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-PurposeOfUse'. It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer, or use the [IG Parameter `pin-canonicals`](https://hl7.org/fhir/tools/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html). Using version '3.1.0', found versions: 3.0.0, 3.1.0. Suggested fix: change the canonical reference from 'http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-PurposeOfUse' to 'http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-PurposeOfUse|3.1.0'%

# Since this IG is based on FHIR R4, the pattern discriminator is still valid. The deprecation warning is for future R5+ compatibility, but it won't break the current implementation.
%The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)%

# The additional specified codes are essential for the management of advance directive documents. The ADI specification team is working with the Structured Documents Working Group to add these additional codes.
%Binding http://hl7.org/fhir/us/pacio-adi/ValueSet/ADIDocumentReferenceStatusVS is not a subset of binding http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/composition-status|4.0.1 because The codes 'current,superseded,entered-in-error' are not in the base valueset%

# XHTML-related error to div. Not relevant if set to div status is generated.
%The markdown contains content that appears to be an embedded HTML tag starting at '<d'. This will (or SHOULD) be escaped by the presentation layer. The content should be checked to confirm that this is the desired behaviour%

# These are local codes that are specific to the context of Advance Directives. Still, the PACIO ADI team intends to continue following the process to work with LOINC and SNOMED to add these codes.
%Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)%

# Advance Directive documents require document types that are currently not supported in US Core. The ADI team is working with Structure Documents and US Core for better alignment. In the meantime, we had to fall back to the DocumentReference base resource.
%US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on DocumentReference derive from one of the base US profiles. See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/US+Core+Variance+Request+Process.%

# The repeating element pattern is intentional for consistency in each ADI profile.
