provenance-1: The left side is inherently a collection, and so the expression '%resource.agent.who.resolve() is Practitioner' may fail or return false if there is more than one item in the content being evaluated

# Since this IG is based on FHIR R4, the pattern discriminator is still valid. The deprecation warning is for future R5+ compatibility, but it won't break the current implementation.
%The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)%
