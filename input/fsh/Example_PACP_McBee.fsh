<p><b>My Advance Care Goals</b></p>

<p>If I am so sick or seriously injured that I cannot express my own medical treatment preferences, and if I am not expected to live without additional treatment for my illness, disease, condition or injury, then I want my medical care team to know that these are the things that are most important to me:</p>
<ol>
	<li><i>Being at peace with my God</i></li>
	<li><i>Dying at home</i></li>
	<li><i>Being able to feed, bathe, and take care of myself</i></li>
	<li><i>Being free from pain</i></li>
	<li><i>Resolving conflicts</i></li>
	<li><i>Being with my family</i></li>
	<li><i>Not being a financial burden to my family</i></li>
</ol>

<p>If I am having significant pain or suffering, <i>I would like my doctors to consult a Supportive and Palliative Care Team to help treat my physical, emotional and spiritual discomfort, and to support my family.</i></p>

<p><b>My Preferences in Specific Circumstances</b></p>
    
<p>In addition to the general advance care goals provided above, below are specific treatment preferences with respect to certain specific circumstances or situations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If my health ever deteriorates due to a terminal illness, and my doctors believe I will not be able to interact meaningfully with my family, friends, or surroundings, <i>I prefer that they stop all life-sustaining treatments and let me die as gently as possible.  I realize that I will not receive life-sustaining treatments including but not limited to breathing machines, blood transfusions, dialysis, heart machines, and IV drugs to keep my heart working.  I also realize that medical personnel will not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and they will allow me to die naturally.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If my response above indicates that I do not want life-sustaining treatments,</p>
<p>I expressly authorize my attending physician to withhold or withdraw artificial nutrition and hydration and instruct my healthcare agent (or, if I have not designated a healthcare agent, my default surrogate), my family and the doctors and nurses who are taking care of me to respect this request.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>If I have a severe, irreversible brain injury or illness and canâ€™t dress, feed, or bathe myself, or communicate my medical wishes, but doctors can keep me alive in this condition for a long period of time, <i>I would like for them to keep trying life-sustaining treatments for 2 months.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although I understand that, depending on the situation and circumstances, medical personnel may not be able to follow my wishes, here are my general thoughts on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR):</p>
<p><i>I do not want CPR attempted.</i></p>
<p><i>I want my healthcare agent to make the decision, but if my chances are slim to none that I'll leave the hospital, even if they resuscitate me, then I absolutely do not want CPR.</i></p>
<p> </p>

<p><b>Other Instructions</b></p>
<p>If it were possible to choose, here is where I would like to spend my final days:</p>
<p><i>At home.I would like to receive hospice care at home if possible.</i></p>
