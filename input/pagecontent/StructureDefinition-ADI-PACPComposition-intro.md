The Personal ACP subset of advance healthcare directive documents is always authored by the subject of the document (the person or patient). If care team members are involved in the creation of advance healthcare directive types of documents, they may be included as “facilitators” or contributors to the process, but they may or may not be signers of the resultant document. The person (or their representative) is required to sign the Personal ACP document and is represented as personal attester. Others who sign the document are represented as attesters, with their role of witness (official) or notary (professional).
The Personal ACP Composition which is being exchanged or made accessible includes a representation of the completed source form. The Composition can also include information about:

* The person’s appointed healthcare agent(s), 
* Treatment intervention **_and_** care experience preferences, with the ability to further specify those preferences under potential, future health scenarios
* Administrative information; Completion information; Additional Documentation; and Upon death preferences; and 
* Witness and notary information (if that information is required for the specific form being represented to be considered valid.) 

An advance healthcare directive document must always contain the source form representation in the Source Form section. It may include other textual information organized in standard structural sections, which may or may not include machine processable encoded entries.
