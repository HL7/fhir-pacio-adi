**Conformance:**

Advance Directive Information VersionNumber Extension represents a numeric value used to version successive replacement documents. Best practice for systems that support distributed document creation and updating is to populate the versionNumber with the timestamp created from the date/time when the version of the document is created in the system.  Note: this may or may not be equivalent to the timestamp integer for Composition.date. the versionNumber timestamp always will be equivalent to the Bundle.timestamp for the document.   

For documents created within a system will follow the pattern that the timestamp-label versionNumber will be equivalent to the timestamp of the Composition.date and the Bundle.timestamp. However, for unstructured historical documents uploaded into a system, the timestamp-label versionNumber will be equivalent to the timestamp of the  the Bundle.timestamp, but the Composition.date will reflect the creation date of the original document.

This profile defines constraints that represent the information needed to register an advance directive information document on a FHIR server. Temporal information is essential to the document registration process.  DocumentReference.date holds the date when the document was registered and DocumentReference.content.attachment.creation holds the "creation date" associated with the document itself.
