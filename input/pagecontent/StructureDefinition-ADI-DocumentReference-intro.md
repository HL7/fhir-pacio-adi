**Note:** while the conformance defined below is developed the for Advance
Healthcare Directive Interoperability use case, this document management
approach can be utilized for all types of documents under management
through a FHIR server.

**Conformance:**

The DocumentReference Resources on a FHIR server function as a sort of
"card catalog" or indexing system that makes it easy to find and access
information made available through the FHIR server.

Each DocumentReference Resource contains information about the index
card itself, used to facilitate searchability ("DocumentReference
Metadata"), and information about the document the index card is making
findable ("Document Metadata"). This makes understanding document
management via FHIR a complex, multidimensional situation where it is
necessary to understand the difference between these two types of
information in each DocumentReference Resource.

The information below summarizes the purpose of key fields in the
DocumentReference Resources divided between DocumentReference Metadata
and Document Metadata.

**DocumentReference Key Metadata**

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| DocumentReference.meta | The meta data fields of the DocumentReference contain information like id, lastUpdated, and versionId which describe the DocumentReference Resource itself. |
| DocumentReference.status | Tells the status of the index information in the document registration system itself. |
| DocumentReference.relatesTo | A linking pointer that allows one index card to point to a different index card to manage information within the indexing system through relationships such as replaces and signs.<br/><br/>In document exchange, the relatesTo.target may utilize a contained DocumentReference which specifies the MasterIdentifier of the related document to enable a recipient system to utilize the relationship information. |
| DocumentReference.date | When this DocumentReference was created. |

**Document Metadata**

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| DocumentReference.masterIdentifier | The meta data fields of the DocumentReference contain information like id, lastUpdated, and versionId which describe the DocumentReference Resource itself. |
| DocumentReference.identifier | Tells the status of the index information in the document registration system itself. |
| DocumentReference.extension:<br/>DocumentReferenceVersionNumber | VersionNumber is used to establish the order of successive representations (versions) of a single logical document.<br/><br/>In systems that support federated creation and use of documents, such as for advance healthcare directives, the versionNumber field is a string value generated by determining the Epoc Unix timestamp associated with the UTC time of the document's creation, accurate to the millisecond. |
| DocumentReference.relatesTo | A linking pointer that allows one index card to point to a different index card to manage information within the indexing system that enables the system to represent the relationships between documents such as replaces and signs. |
| DocumentReference.DocStatus | The status of the document. Many document registries only provide access to completed documents. |
| DocumentReference.extension:<br/>DocumentRevokeStatus | Used to indicate when a completed document has subsequently been voided ("cancelled"), deprecated ("deprecated"), or marked as entered-in-error ("entered-in-error"). This often involved creating a new version of the logic document which carries a watermark indicating its revocation status. The Document Metadata and DocumentReference Metadata enables the revocation to be a transparent action that is readily visible in the indexing system. |
| DocumentReference.category | The broad domain classifications for the type of document. The category ontology may be specific to the document registry. Use of standardized categories facilitates easier interoperability. Multiple categories may apply. |
| DocumentReference.type | The specific type classification for the type of document. Use of standardized document types facilitates easier interoperability. Although a single type is required, the coding permits more granular types to also be included in use cases where that is helpful. |
| DocumentReference.description | May include the title of the document or a more generalized description for normalizing documents in the indexing system or a combination of the two. |
| DocumentReference.content.attachment | Each available document is carried in the attachment parameter of the DocumentReference index card. |
| DocumentReference.content.format | The format code tells which IG the attachment is conformant to. This helps document seekers determine which attachment suits their use. |
| DocumentReference.content.attachment.<br/>contentType | contentType tells the media type of the attachment. |
| DocumentReference.content.attachment.<br/>data | data enables the attachment to be included when the index card is accessed |
| DocumentReference.content.attachment.<br/>url | url enables the attachment to be located elsewhere so it only is accessed when wanted, making the index card a smaller object use just for finding the desired information before retrieving it. |
| DocumentReference.content.attachment.<br/>title | Title matches the title of the attachment. If the attachment has a specific title, the exact title will be used in the DocumentReference index card. If the attachment doesn't have a specific title, the title may be something generalized but useful for identifying the attachment if it is stored or used elsewhere. |
| DocumentReference.content.attachment.<br/>creation | The system origination date associated with the attachment. |
| DocumentReference.extension:<br/>authenticationTime | The date/time when the document was considered completed, i.e. the date/time when all completion requirements were met.<br/><br/>In the case of scanned documents this information may not be available, or it may only be known to the date with no time information include. |
| DocumentReference.context.period.start | Context information is relative to the document management system holding the information.<br/><br/>In the case of Advance Healthcare Directives, a national registry may consider the authenticationTime the relevant period.start for the document. Or it may consider the origination time of the document in the registry (content.creationTime) to be the period.start.<br/><br/>In document exchange, the date the document was originated on the recipient's system may be considered the relevant context.period.start for the document in the context of their medical/legal record for the patient. Or they may prefer to use the authenticationTime as the context.period.start. |
| DocumentReference.context.period.end | Period.end holds the expiration date for the document if one exists in the document or is applied in the context of use. |
| DocumentReference.context.encounter | Context information is relative to the document management system holding the information.<br/><br/>In the case of Advance Healthcare Directives, a national registry may not include a relevant encounter.<br/><br/>In document exchange, a healthcare organization how is retrieving/receiving an Advance Healthcare Directive may choose to associate the document with the specific encounter which was associated with the access and use of the information. |
