The ADI Care Experience preference is a mechanism for the patient to represent their thoughts about the care they will receive (before and after an emergency health crisis) and is intended to inform the care team who may not know anything about them what is important to them as care is delivered.  Aspects of the patientâ€™s personal preferences and priorities such as what they like or find joy in, what they dislike or fear, what matters to them, the role religion, faith, or spirituality play in their life, and who they might want contacted to support those beliefs are examples of what is represented in this section.
