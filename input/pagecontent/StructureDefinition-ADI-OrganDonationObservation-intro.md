The ADI Organ donation observation is used to represent the patientâ€™s documented decisions regarding organ and tissue donation, and any specifics as to how the organ and tissue donations are to be used, should the patient pass away.  These decisions can be documented in narrative form or as a result of selecting from a list of options provided by the content creator/implementer.  Enabling the patient to state their preferences for organ and tissue donation is an important element in representing their goals, preferences, and priorities for activities that occur upon death.
