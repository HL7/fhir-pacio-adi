The ADI goal represents the patient’s advance healthcare decision goals for the medical interventions that will be part of the clinician-authored care plan that will drive treatment.  The patient’s documented goals of the medical care they will receive is based on the context or condition specified, and is intended to guide the provider-authored interventions that will be documented by the care team providing the treatment interventions that meet those documented patient goals. This allows a person-centered approach to care planning that reflects the specific goals, preferences, and priorities of that person which can then be merged with the clinical care plan so as to enable a jointly developed plan of care between the provider and person receiving care.
