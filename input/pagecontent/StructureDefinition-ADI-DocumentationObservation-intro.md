The ADI Document observation represents the existence of any advance directive documents the patient may want to notify the treating care team of, so as to further support personalized care delivery.  The observation is not intended to communicate the actual contents of those additional documents, if they exist, but are intended to represent that the documents exist so that further investigation can be undertaken to locate them or learn more about them.  Duplicate form completion, inconsistent form responses, and siloed documents are a source of misinformation and confusion during care delivery so this section is intended to create awareness that other forms of advance healthcare decisions exist that the person wants others to be aware of in an effort to potentially locate the documents so as to reduce confusion and misinformation.
