The Personal Intervention preference represents the patient’s preferences for treatment interventions based on their personal goals and priorities.  The patient may indicate whether they wish to issue an advance directive (instruction) to receive intubation, tube feeding, life support, and/or pain management to name a few.  The preferences may be documented in narrative form or the result of selecting from a list of options provided by the content creator/implementer.  Enabling the patient to state the interventions they want to receive so the care team is aware of those preferences can have a meaningful impact on the ability of the provider to deliver person-centered care that reflects the patient’s values and priorities for treatment.
