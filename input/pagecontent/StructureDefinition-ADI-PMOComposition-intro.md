Portable medical orders are always authored by the provider who legally authenticates the document. The signing provider is represented as the legal attester. If other care team members are involved in the creation of these types of documents, they may be included as facilitators or contributors to the process, but they may or may not be signers of the resultant document. Other care team members who sign the document are represented as professional attesters. The person/patient (or their representative) is required to sign the document and is represented as a personal attester.
The PMO Composition which is being exchanged or made accessible includes a representation of the completed source form of the document. The Composition can also include information about:

* Medical orders for certain treatment interventions intended to be honored and followed by other care providers
* The person’s appointed healthcare agent,
* Administrative information; Completion information; Additional Documentation; Upon death preferences, especially organ donation, and
* Witness and notary information (if that information is required for the specific form being represented to be considered valid.) 

An advance healthcare directive document must always contain the source form representation in the Source Form section. It may include other textual information organized in standard structural sections which may or may not include machine processable encoded entries.
