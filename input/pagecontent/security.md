### Security, Privacy, and Consent

[TODO]

This Implementation Guide leverages the [SMART-on-FHIR](http://docs.smarthealthit.org/) and [OAuth2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) standards, which add authentication and authorization capabilities to FHIR. This architecture is intended to maximize the number of clinical systems that conform to this guide as well as to allow for easy growth and extensibility of system capabilities in the future.
