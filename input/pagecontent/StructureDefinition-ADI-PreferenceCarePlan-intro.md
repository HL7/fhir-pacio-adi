The ADI Person-authored Care Plan represents the patient’s goals for treatment based on circumstances or situations that provide context for the goals documented.  A patient could document their goal of care in a situation such as a terminal condition that will result in their death in a relatively short period of time as being to extend their life for as long as possible, or allow their natural death to occur, or allow limited treatments to occur for a certain period of time before they are stopped.  In a different situation, such as permanent and severe brain damage from which they are not expected to recover, that their goal of care options may be the same but their documented selection is different.  Various forms and jurisdictions include circumstances or situations that are relatively consistent but still vary somewhat, so this Resource allows the basic structure of a context or circumstance or situation to be defined, against which the identification of a goal is documented, and against which in some existing forms further identification of the patient’s preference for interventions is captured.  To enable the patient’s own preferred plan of care to merge with the care team’s clinical plan of care results in a jointly-authored and patient-centered plan of care that is informed by the person receiving care and the care team responsible for delivering that care.
