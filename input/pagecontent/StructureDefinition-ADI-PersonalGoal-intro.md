The ADI Personal goal represents the patient’s personal goals and values related to quality of life that are intended to inform the treatment being provided.  This may be communicated as a statement of what is important to the patient to have a good quality of life, such as avoiding prolonged dependence on machines or being able to feed, bathe, and take care of themselves.  They may want to be to be able to die at home or not be a financial burden to their family.  Content creators or implementers may provide a list of things the patient can select that are personally important to them or the decisions may be captured in narrative form.  Without any more specificity than what the personal goal of the patient is, a medical team may be able to narrow down a list of potential treatment interventions to just a few whose outcomes would enable meeting the patient’s documented personal goals and values.
