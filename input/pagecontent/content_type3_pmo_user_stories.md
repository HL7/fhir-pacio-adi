### Introduction 


#### Example Persona

The following story continues the <a href="type1_user_stories_and_personas.html">Content Type 1 user story</a> for patient-authored advance directive.

Five years after Betsy Smith-Johnson creates her ADD, in 2020, Betsy moves to Michigan to spend time with her son Charles. She finds a new PCP, Dr. Anita Chu, near her new home in Michigan. With Betsy's consent, Dr. Chuâ€™s queries the AD/ACP/PMO registry & repository for Betsy's advance directives via the practitioner-facing app. Together they review her Texas Living Will, updated Michigan AD, and PACP documents. Dr. Chu suggests that it may be appropriate to complete a PMO, specifically a POLST Model form, to ensure that her GPPs are able to be honored should she require emergency care in her new home state.

Betsy uses a consumer-facing app to upload an updated Michigan AD form with her correct address, to replace the previous version, on December 21, 2020.  The following day she updates her PACP with her new address and revised HCA designations, on December 22, 2020.  The last thing Betsy does in her consumer-facing app is to revoke/cancel the Texas Living Will since it no longer current and she intends for her other ADI documents to inform any future medical care.

The updated Michigan AD, updated PACP, and newly revoked/voided Texas Living Will documents/status are updated in the AD/ACP/PMO registry and repository.
