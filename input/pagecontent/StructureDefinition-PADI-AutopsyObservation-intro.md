The ADI Autopsy observation is used to represent the patientâ€™s documented decisions regarding autopsy, should they pass away.  These decisions can be documented in narrative form or as a result of selecting from a list of options provided by the content creator/implementer.  Enabling the patient to state their preferences for autopsy is an important element in representing their goals, preferences, and priorities for activities that occur upon death.
